## Prerequisite

This course expects you already know about
* kotlin language
It means if you are not familiar with kotlin, you can't read this
course.
It simply says I don't write the details of it.
If you so, you might need to consult another course.
* Event handler in GUI element
Like other window system, it uses event handling mechanisms for each
GUI element such as Button.
Although it was difficult point for me in my days, but I can't explain
it well.
So, if you aren't familier with it, you might need to learn event handling
in window system before starting the course.

Also, I request you not to expect the following topics:
* GUI design
You never know about it in the course.
In addition, never ask me about the topic.
I may not provide any information for you.
